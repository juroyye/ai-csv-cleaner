**Data Quality Cleaning Report**

**1. Overview of the Dataset**  
The dataset consists of 100 rows and 6 columns, capturing customer orders for various flavors. The columns include `customer_id`, `name`, `flavor`, `order_date`, `quantity`, and `member`. Each column has been assessed for data quality, and the data types are as follows: `customer_id` (number), `name` (text), `flavor` (text), `order_date` (date), `quantity` (text), and `member` (text). Notably, there are no missing values across any of the columns.

**2. Summary of All Changes Applied**  
The following cleaning action was performed on the dataset:
- Whitespace was stripped from the `name` column to ensure consistency in formatting.

**3. Issues Flagged for Human Review**  
Several issues have been identified that require further examination:
- **Invalid date format**: The `order_date` for `customer_id` 5 is not in a recognizable date format.
- **Non-numeric quantity value**: The `quantity` for `customer_id` 6 contains a non-numeric entry ("three").
- **Empty quantity values**: The `quantity` fields for `customer_id` 4 and 20 are empty.
- **Inconsistent categorical values**: The `member` column contains inconsistent entries across multiple customer IDs, indicating variations in how membership status is recorded.

**4. Recommendations for Next Steps**  
To enhance the quality of the dataset, the following actions are recommended:
- Review and correct the invalid date format for `customer_id` 5 to ensure it adheres to a standard date format.
- Standardize the `quantity` values to ensure they are all numeric, addressing the non-numeric entry for `customer_id` 6.
- Fill in or remove the empty `quantity` values for `customer_id` 4 and 20 based on business rules.
- Normalize the entries in the `member` column to ensure consistency, potentially converting all values to a standard format (e.g., "yes", "no").

**5. Warnings About Data Quality Risks**  
There are several risks associated with the current state of the dataset:
- The presence of inconsistent categorical values in the `member` column could lead to inaccurate analysis and reporting.
- Non-standard date formats may result in errors during data processing or analysis, affecting time-based insights.
- Non-numeric and empty values in the `quantity` column can hinder quantitative analysis and lead to misleading conclusions.

Addressing these issues promptly will significantly improve the overall data quality and reliability of insights derived from this dataset.
